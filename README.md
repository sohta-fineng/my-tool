# Financial Engineering Self-Directed Study (2025-2028)

Welcome to my repository. I am an independent scholar dedicated to mastering the intersection of Finance and Mathematics. Starting in January 2025, I bypassed traditional academic curricula to build a self-directed, rigorous study path. My goal is to evolve into a **Financial Engineer** capable of contributing to global, small-scale high-impact projects by 2028.

---

## 🗓️ Roadmap
- **2026 (Current)**: Obtain certifications in accounting, IT engineering, and statistics.
- **2027**: Conduct independent research through coding and publish results on GitHub.
- **2028**: Participate in hackathons and competitions → Gain hands-on experience.

## 📈 Featured Projects

### 1. AMD: Angular Momentum Difference
A proprietary technical indicator designed to quantify the "difference in momentum" between short-term and long-term trends.
- **Concept**: Calculates the difference in the angles ($\arctan$) of moving averages on a logarithmic scale.
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Integrates an entropy-like function $f(x) = (cx)\ln(cx)$ to adjust capital allocation based on signal strength.
- **Goal**: Minimize "whipsaws" (false signals) and automate tiered profit-taking.

### 2. Arbitrage Percentage Envelope (PPP Friction Model)
A macro-algorithmic approach to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) that accounts for real-world market frictions.
- **The "Three Frictions"**: 
  1. **Transportation Costs**: Physical movement of goods/people.
  2. **Transaction Costs**: Tariffs, insurance, and psychological/institutional barriers.
  3. **Information Asymmetry**: Time lags between opportunity recognition and execution.
- **Implementation**: Modeling an "envelope" around PPP to identify true arbitrage opportunities where price deviations exceed the sum of weighted friction constants.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy & Methodology
- **Using generative AI**:I leverage **Generative AI** as a high-leverage tool to accelerate my knowledge acquisition and refine my conceptual frameworks. Where I provide the unique ideas and logical structure, and AI assists in polishing implementations and linguistic precision.
- **Language Strategy**: Thinking logically in English, intuiting in Japanese.
- **2026 Focus**: Establishing a rigorous foundation in Mathematics and Economics.
- **Academic Milestone**: Currently preparing for the **USCPA (U.S. Certified Public Accountant)** exam in 2026 to solidify my understanding of accounting as the "language of business."
- **Tools**: Notion (Log), GitHub (Implementation).
